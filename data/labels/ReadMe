Abstract:
    We have undertaken an ambitious program to visually classify all
    galaxies in the five CANDELS fields down to H<24.5 involving the
    dedicated efforts of over 65 individual classifiers. Once completed,
    we expect to have detailed morphological classifications for over
    50000 galaxies spanning 0<z<4 over all the fields, with
    classifications from 3 to 5 independent classifiers for each galaxy.
    Here, we present our detailed visual classification scheme, which was
    designed to cover a wide range of CANDELS science goals. This scheme
    includes the basic Hubble sequence types, but also includes a detailed
    look at mergers and interactions, the clumpiness of galaxies,
    k-corrections, and a variety of other structural properties. In this
    paper, we focus on the first field to be completed --GOODS-S, which has
    been classified at various depths. The wide area coverage spanning the
    full field (wide+deep+ERS) includes 7634 galaxies that have been
    classified by at least three different people. In the deep area of the
    field, 2534 galaxies have been classified by at least five different
    people at three different depths. With this paper, we release to the
    public all of the visual classifications in GOODS-S along with the
    Perl/Tk GUI that we developed to classify galaxies. We present our
    initial results here, including an analysis of our internal
    consistency and comparisons among multiple classifiers as well as a
    comparison to the Sersic index. We find that the level of agreement
    among classifiers is quite good (>70% across the full magnitude range)
    and depends on both the galaxy magnitude and the galaxy type, with
    disks showing the highest level of agreement (>50%) and irregulars the
    lowest (<10%). A comparison of our classifications with the Sersic
    index and rest-frame colors shows a clear separation between disk and
    spheroid populations. Finally, we explore morphological k-corrections
    between the V-band and H-band observations and find that a small
    fraction (84 galaxies in total) are classified as being very different
    between these two bands. These galaxies typically have very clumpy and
    extended morphology or are very faint in the V-band.

Description:
    The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Dark Energy Legacy Survey (CANDELS)
    is an HST Multi-Cycle Treasury Program to image portions of five of
    the most commonly studied legacy fields (GOODS-N, GOODS-S, COSMOS, UDS
    and EGS) with WFC3 in the NIR. The survey has observed all five fields
    to 2-orbit depth in F125W (J-band, 2/3 orbit) and F160W (H-band, 4/3
    orbit) and the central regions of GOODS-N and GOODS-S to 10 orbit
    depth in these bands as well as F105W (Y-band). ACS parallel imaging
    has also been obtained for all of these fields in F814W and F606W. For
    details on the full CANDELS survey, see Grogin et al.
    (2011ApJS..197...35G). In addition to the CANDELS observations, a
    portion of GOODS-S was also observed as a part of the WFC3 Early
    Release Science (ERS; Windhorst et al. 2011ApJS..193...27W) campaign
    in Y, J, and H.

    The CANDELS observations began in 2010 October and were completed in
    2013 August. For this paper, we use mosaics at three different depths
    for comparison.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on table2.dat and table3.dat: There are two different flavors of
  catalogs --the "raw" and the "fractional." The raw catalogs are simply
  collections of all of the raw classifications. Each object therefore has
  multiple entries (as many entries as there are classifiers) and each
  classifier is identified by a unique number. The second set of catalogs,
  the "fractional" ones, are the ones that are most likely to be useful to the
  community. These catalogs contain one entry per object and each classification
  is marked by the fraction of people who checked that box. So if one out of
  three classifiers classified an object as a disk, one as irregular, and two as
  a spheroid, then the disk column will have the value 0.33, the spheroid
  column 0.67, and the irregular column as 0.33. We have created separate
  catalogs for each depth. There is a 2-epoch depth catalog covering the entire
  GOODS-S field, one covering just the deep region, and one each covering the
  deep region at 4- and 10-epoch depths.

Note (1): Object Identifier is an object number the SExtractor catalog based
    on 6-epoch GOODS-S mosaic with a prefix indicating the region and depth,
    e.g., deep2

Global notes:
Note (G1): We use a uniform 2-orbit depth (J+H) mosaic across the full field.
  This mosaic represents the wide coverage that has been obtained for all five
  CANDELS fields. For the deep region of GOODS-S, we also use a 4-orbit
  (available at the beginning of the visual classifications) and the final
  10-orbit depth mosaic in order to test the dependence of our classifications
  on image depth. See section 2.1.
Note (G2): <CANDELS UDS F160W JHHMMSS.ss+DDMMSS.s> in Simbad.
